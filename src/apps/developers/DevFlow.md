Considering your scenario, where developers initially apply for specific roles without being registered as full-time users, and later may become in-house developers, we can design the system to provide a smooth transition and user experience.

Here's a suggested approach:

Role Application without Full Registration:

Allow developers to apply for specific roles without going through the full registration process.

Capture the necessary information during the role application, and store it in a separate table or collection in the database.
Notification and Acceptance:

Once a developer is accepted for a specific role,we send them a notification via email.
The email can contain a unique link with a token or a secure, time-limited password that allows them to access a limited part of the system related to the applied role.
Limited Access:

Allow developers to access a restricted part of the system with the provided credentials.
In this limited access, they can view details related to the applied role, communicate with the client, and possibly perform certain actions relevant to the application.
Full Registration upon Acceptance:

When a developer is accepted as a full-time in-house developer, prompt them to complete their registration by providing additional information and setting up a permanent username and password.
We can guide them to a dedicated registration page with pre-filled information from their previous role application.
Optional Password Change:

Allow developers to change their password or other account details once they have completed the full registration process.
This approach allows developers to smoothly transition from role applicants to full-time in-house developers without the need for re-registration. It also provides a level of security by initially providing limited access and requiring full registration upon acceptance.

Limited Access Credentials:

When providing limited access credentials to developers, it's generally a good practice not to allow them to change these credentials initially. The limited access credentials are specifically tied to the role application process, and changing them might complicate the tracking and verification process.
Misplacement of Credentials:

To handle the misplacement of credentials, consider including a secure, time-limited link in the email notifications. This link could allow developers to access the limited part of the system without requiring manual input of credentials. This is commonly used in account verification processes.
Security Measures:
We can consider additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), to enhance the security of the limited access.
Changing Credentials Later:

Once the developer completes full registration (as discussed earlier), they should be able to set up a permanent username and password. At this stage, you can allow them to change their password, providing a more traditional account management experience.
Email Communication:

Continuously communicate with developers through email, providing guidance on the next steps and access information. If credentials are lost or misplaced, developers can use the secure, time-limited link mentioned earlier for access.
By combining secure links, clear communication, and a smooth transition to full registration, we can balance security with a user-friendly experience.
