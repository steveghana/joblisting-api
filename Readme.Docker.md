Project Name
Overview
This project is a monorepo containing a React TypeScript frontend, a NestJS backend, and a PostgreSQL database. Docker is used for containerization, making it easier to manage dependencies and deploy the application consistently.

Prerequisites
Docker: Install Docker
Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Environment Variables:

Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the variables as needed.

Local Development:

Run the following command to start the local development environment using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This command will spin up containers for the backend and database. Access the application at http://localhost:3000 for the frontend and http://localhost:5000 for the backend.

Build and Deploy:

Use the following commands to build and deploy the application:

Build Docker Images:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
Deploy:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
The application is now deployed, and you can access it in production.

Clean Up:

To stop the Docker containers, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
This stops and removes the containers.

Additional Commands
View Docker Logs:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f
Access PostgreSQL Database:

bash
Copy code
docker exec -it <database-container-id> psql -U <database-username> -d <database-name>
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the logs using docker-compose logs.
Ensure that the necessary ports are not in use locally.
